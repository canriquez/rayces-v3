## üö® **Risk Management**

### **Critical Risks (Current)**
1. **MVP Demo Deadline**: 16 days remaining - Very High Priority
2. **Sprint Structure**: No active sprints - Immediate action required

4. **Multi-tenancy Complexity**: Technical risk requiring extra time
5. **Frontend Integration**: NextAuth.js + Rails JWT coordination

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Sprint Creation**: Immediate Jira sprint setup required
- **Team Expansion**: Consider additional developers for Sprint 2-3
- **Scope Management**: Prepare MVP demo scope reduction if needed
- **Parallel Development**: Start frontend work early in Sprint 2
