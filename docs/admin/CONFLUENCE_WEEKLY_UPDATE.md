## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **MyHub Foundation Extension Strategy**
**Building on existing operational components**:
- ✅ **Rails 7 API**: User, Post, Like models with PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Authentication**: Google OAuth via NextAuth.js
- ✅ **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with K8s manifests
- ✅ **Real-time**: ActionCable for WebSocket communication

**Extension Approach**:
- **User Model** → Multi-tenant users with organization_id
- **Post System** → Appointment booking with AASM state machine
- **Feed Interface** → Professional availability calendar
- **Like System** → Booking confirmations and notifications

### **Technology Stack** (Current Status)
- **Backend**: Rails 7 API + PostgreSQL + Redis + Sidekiq ✅ (MyHub + extensions)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Zustand ✅ (MyHub + booking UI)
- **Authentication**: Devise + JWT + NextAuth.js + OmniAuth 🔄 (MyHub + multi-tenancy)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes + Docker + GitHub Actions ✅ (evolved from docker-compose)
- **Payments**: Mercado Pago SDK ⏳ (future - Phase 3)
- **AI/Automation**: n8n + WhatsApp Business API ⏳ (future - Phase 4)

### **Key Architectural Decisions**
1. **Multi-tenancy**: acts_as_tenant with organization-based isolation (Sprint 1)
2. **State Management**: AASM for booking workflow (Sprint 3+)
3. **API Design**: RESTful with versioning (/api/v1/)
4. **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth hybrid approach (Sprint 1-2)
5. **Real-time**: Action Cable for live booking updates (Sprint 4+)
6. **Background Jobs**: Sidekiq for email and notifications (Sprint 4+)
