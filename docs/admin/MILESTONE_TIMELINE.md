## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks (Updated July 8, 2025)
1. **MVP Demo Deadline (July 18)**: 10 days remaining - Critical urgency
2. **Sprint 1 Completion**: Must complete by July 8 for milestone success
3. **Sprint 2 & 3 Unassigned**: Immediate assignment required
4. **Single Developer Dependency**: Carlos handling 42 points across sprints
5. **Multi-tenancy complexity**: SCRUM-33 requires careful implementation

### Contingency Plans
- **If Sprint 1 delayed**: Prioritize SCRUM-32, 33, 37 for core functionality
- **If Sprint 2 at risk**: Reduce demo scope to basic booking flow only
- **If Sprint 3 critical**: Use mock data for demo presentation
- **If team overwhelmed**: Consider additional developers for Sprint 2

## Team Velocity Assumptions
- **Sprint 1**: 26-30 points (Carlos, backend focus)
- **Sprint 2**: 26-30 points (requires additional team members)
- **Sprint 3**: 20-25 points (2.5 day sprint for demo prep)
- **Buffer**: 20% for unknowns and integration challenges

## Current Project Status
- **Overall Progress**: 20% Complete (SCRUM-32 in progress)
- **Next Critical Milestone**: Sprint 1 completion (July 8)
- **Days to MVP Demo**: 10 days remaining
- **Risk Level**: High (sprint planning and team assignment critical)
