## Success Criteria

### Booking MVP Demo (July 18)

- [ ] Professional can set availability
- [ ] Client can view available slots
- [ ] Client can book an appointment
- [ ] Confirmation emails sent
- [ ] Basic multi-tenant isolation working

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **MVP Demo Deadline (July 18)**: 16 days remaining - High urgency
2. **Single Developer Dependency**: Carlos handling 7 critical stories
3. **No Active Sprint Structure**: Sprint creation required immediately
4. **Multi-tenancy complexity**: Allocate extra time in Sprint 1
5. **Frontend integration**: Parallel development recommended

### Contingency Plans
- If MVP demo at risk: Reduce scope to core booking only
- If August deadline at risk: Defer credit system to September
- If single developer overwhelmed: Consider additional team members
- If multi-tenancy complex: Prepare single-tenant fallback for demo

## Team Velocity Assumptions
- 2-week sprints (except Sprint 3: 3.5 days)
- 25-30 story points per sprint target
- 20% buffer for unknowns
- Focus on MVP-critical features first

## Current Project Status
- **Overall Progress**: 15% Complete
- **Phase**: Foundation Development (Active)
- **Active Sprint**: No active sprint (requires creation)
- **Next Milestone**: MVP Demo (July 18) - 16 days remaining
- **Primary Developer**: Carlos Anriquez (multiple roles)
