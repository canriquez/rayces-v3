## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Multi-tenancy complexity**: Allocate extra time in Sprint 1
2. **Third-party integrations**: Start Mercado Pago PoC early
3. **WhatsApp API limits**: Research alternatives in parallel

### Contingency Plans
- If MVP demo at risk: Reduce scope to core booking only
- If August deadline at risk: Defer credit system to September
- If AI features complex: Consider manual workflow first

## Team Velocity Assumptions
- 2-week sprints
- 40-60 story points per sprint
- 20% buffer for unknowns
- No major holidays impacting July-August
