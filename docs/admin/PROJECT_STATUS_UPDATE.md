## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Risks (Current)
1. **MVP Demo Deadline**: 16 days remaining
   - **Impact**: Very High
   - **Probability**: Medium (manageable with sprint creation)
   - **Mitigation**: Immediate sprint creation, scope prioritization

2. **Single Developer Dependency**: Carlos handling 42 story points
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Probability**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Consider additional team members for Sprint 2-3

3. **No Active Sprint Structure**: Sprint creation required
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Probability**: High (current state)
   - **Mitigation**: Immediate Jira sprint setup

4. **Multi-tenancy Implementation Complexity**: Technical challenge
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Research acts_as_tenant patterns, allocate extra Sprint 1 time

5. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: NextAuth.js + Rails JWT coordination
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel development, early integration testing

### Technical Risks
1. **Authentication Integration**
   - Risk: NextAuth.js and Rails JWT synchronization
   - Mitigation: Define API contracts early, integration testing

2. **Real-time Features**
   - Risk: Action Cable scaling for multi-tenancy
   - Mitigation: Redis clustering configuration, WebSocket alternatives

3. **Database Performance**
   - Risk: Multi-tenant query performance
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, query optimization

### Business Risks
1. **Feature Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Demo scope expansion beyond MVP
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP focus, defer advanced features

2. **Team Capacity**
   - Risk: Single developer bottleneck
   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical path, consider team expansion

3. **Integration Dependencies**
   - Risk: Third-party service limitations
   - Mitigation: Mock services for demo, real integration post-demo
