## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### MyHub Foundation Context
**Building on existing MyHub social media foundation**:
- ✅ Rails 7 API already operational with User, Post, Like models
- ✅ Google OAuth authentication via NextAuth.js
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with proper relationships

**Extension Strategy**:
- User Model → Multi-tenant users with organization_id
- Post System → Appointment booking system with AASM
- Feed Interface → Booking calendar and availability
- Authentication → Extended with Devise/JWT + multi-tenancy

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rails 7 API-only mode (extending MyHub)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router (extending MyHub)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with multi-tenancy (extending MyHub)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes + Docker (evolved from MyHub)
- **Authentication**: JWT with SSO support (extending MyHub)
- **State Management**: AASM for workflows (new)
- **Background Jobs**: Sidekiq (extending MyHub)
- **Real-time**: Action Cable (extending MyHub)

## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### **Critical Risks (Updated July 8, 2025)**

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **MVP Demo Deadline (July 18)** | High | High | 🔴 Active | Sprint 1 completion by July 8 |
| **Single Developer Dependency** | High | High | 🔴 Critical | Carlos handling all foundation work |
| **Sprint 2 & 3 Unassigned** | High | High | 🔴 Immediate | Assign stories by July 8 |
| **Multi-tenancy Complexity** | High | Medium | 🟡 Active | SCRUM-33 scheduled after SCRUM-32 |
| **Frontend Integration** | Medium | Medium | 🟡 Monitoring | Parallel development needed |

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Complete SCRUM-32** by July 8 - Rails 7 API setup
2. **Create Sprint 2** (July 9-15) - MVP Core development
3. **Create Sprint 3** (July 16-18) - MVP Demo preparation
4. **Assign Sprint 2 stories** to developers
5. **Begin Sprint 3 planning** for demo requirements

### **Contingency Plans**
- **If Sprint 1 delayed**: Prioritize SCRUM-32, 33, 37 for MVP
- **If Sprint 2 at risk**: Reduce demo scope to basic booking only
- **If Sprint 3 critical**: Use mock data for demo if needed
- **If single developer overwhelmed**: Consider additional team members
