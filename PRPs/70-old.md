# PRP-70: Complete API Controller Authorization Implementation

## Goal
Complete the authorization gap identified in SCRUM-33 by implementing comprehensive Pundit policy business logic for all API controllers, ensuring secure multi-tenant operations with proper role-based access control.

## Why
- **Critical Gap Resolution**: SCRUM-33 completed multi-tenancy infrastructure but revealed 36 authorization test failures
- **Security Requirement**: Must prevent unauthorized access and cross-tenant data breaches
- **MVP Blocker**: Required for secure API operations before July 18 demo
- **Foundation for Authentication**: Prepares secure endpoint foundation for SCRUM-37-39

## What
Bridge the gap between multi-tenancy infrastructure (SCRUM-33) and authentication implementation (SCRUM-37-39) by completing Pundit policy business logic for secure, tenant-aware API operations.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **All 36 authorization test failures from SCRUM-33 resolved**
- [ ] **OrganizationPolicy implements role-based permissions for all 4 roles**
- [ ] **UserPolicy enforces tenant scoping and role hierarchies**
- [ ] **AppointmentPolicy handles booking authorization logic**
- [ ] **All API::V1 controllers use proper authorize calls**
- [ ] **Policy scoping prevents cross-tenant data access**
- [ ] **403 Forbidden responses for authorization failures (not 401)**
- [ ] **Comprehensive RSpec tests for all authorization scenarios**
- [ ] **Security audit tests prevent privilege escalation**
- [ ] **Zero test failures in authorization-related specs**

## All Needed Context

### SCRUM-33 Foundation (Available)
```yaml
# Successfully completed infrastructure from SCRUM-33
- Multi-tenant data isolation: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- Tenant resolution: ‚úÖ Working (subdomain, headers, JWT)
- Organization-scoped Role and UserRole models: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Enhanced User methods: ‚úÖ Available (enhanced_admin?, enhanced_professional?, etc.)
- ApplicationPolicy base class: ‚úÖ Created with tenant-aware scoping
- JWT validation and tenant context: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
```

### Current State Analysis (From 33-results.md)
```bash
# Test Results: 362 examples, 36 failures, 111 pending
# 
# ‚úÖ WORKING (Infrastructure):
# - Authentication: JWT validation, tenant resolution, user lookup functional
# - Multi-tenancy: Data isolation, tenant scoping operational
# - Models: 174/175 tests passing (99.4% success)
#
# ‚ùå FAILING (Authorization Business Logic):
# - 36 failures due to incomplete Pundit policy business logic
# - Controller authorization calls incomplete
# - Policy scoping needs business rule implementation
#
# üîÑ ERROR PATTERNS:
# - 403 Forbidden responses (vs 401) = auth works, authorization incomplete
# - Policy method missing errors
# - Cross-tenant access not properly prevented
```

### Required Business Logic Implementation

#### Role-Based Permission Matrix
```ruby
# Admin Role: Full organization management
class OrganizationPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def show?
    user.enhanced_admin? || user.enhanced_professional? || user.enhanced_secretary?
  end
  
  def update?
    user.enhanced_admin?
  end
  
  def destroy?
    user.enhanced_admin?
  end
end

# Professional Role: Own availability + assigned students/appointments  
class AppointmentPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def show?
    user.enhanced_admin? || 
    user.enhanced_professional? && (record.professional == user) ||
    user.enhanced_secretary? ||
    user.enhanced_client? && (record.client == user)
  end
  
  def create?
    user.enhanced_admin? || user.enhanced_secretary? || user.enhanced_client?
  end
  
  def update?
    user.enhanced_admin? || 
    user.enhanced_professional? && (record.professional == user) ||
    user.enhanced_secretary?
  end
end

# Secretary Role: Booking management + client support
# Client Role: Own bookings + family member management
```

PUNDIT INTEGRATION:
  - policy_inheritance: "All policies inherit from ApplicationPolicy"
  - user_context: "Use existing pundit_user method from base_controller"
  - scope_resolution: "Leverage policy_scope for index actions"
  
API_CONTROLLERS:
  - authorization_calls: "Add authorize calls to all controller actions"
  - error_handling: "Consistent 403 responses for authorization failures"
  - audit_logging: "Track authorization decisions for security"
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Policy Unit Tests
```bash
# Test individual policy methods
bundle exec rspec spec/policies/ -v

# Expected: All policy methods work correctly for all roles
```

### Level 2: Authorization Integration Tests  
```bash
# Test API controller authorization
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v1/ -v

# Expected: All 36 authorization failures from SCRUM-33 resolved
```

### Level 3: Security Audit Tests
```bash
# Test cross-tenant access prevention
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/authentication_spec.rb -v
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/tenant_isolation_spec.rb -v

# Expected: No cross-tenant access possible, privilege escalation prevented
```

### Level 4: Performance Validation
```bash
# Profile authorization overhead
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/ --profile

# Expected: < 5ms average authorization overhead per request
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Don't implement authentication logic - this is authorization only
- ‚ùå Don't bypass policy checks - every controller action must authorize
- ‚ùå Don't hardcode role names - use enhanced_role? methods
- ‚ùå Don't leak information in error messages - generic 403 responses
- ‚ùå Don't ignore performance - optimize policy queries
- ‚ùå Don't skip security tests - comprehensive negative testing required
- ‚ùå Don't break SCRUM-33 foundation - build on existing infrastructure

## Success Confidence Score: 9/10

**High confidence due to:**
- Clear gap identification from SCRUM-33 results
- Solid foundation already in place (multi-tenancy working)
- Specific failing test patterns identified (36 failures)
- Existing ApplicationPolicy and enhanced User methods
- Role-based permission matrix clearly defined
- Comprehensive validation strategy

**1 point deducted for:** Potential edge cases in complex role interactions and ensuring optimal performance under load.
