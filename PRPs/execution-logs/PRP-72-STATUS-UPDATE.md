# PRP-72 Status Update

**Date**: July 16, 2025 - 9:10 PM
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Progress**: ~30% Complete

## Current Situation

After initial fixes, we have made some progress but encountered significant issues:

### Test Results
- **Professional Model Tests**: ✅ All 23 tests passing
- **Appointment Model Tests**: ✅ All 31 tests passing  
- **Appointments API Tests**: ❌ 17/27 failures (only index working)
- **Authentication Tests**: ❌ Multiple 404 and 500 errors
- **Worker Tests**: ❌ Symbol vs String key errors

## What Was Fixed

1. **Professional Model**
   - Implemented `available_at?(datetime)` method
   - Implemented `has_conflicting_appointment?(datetime, duration)` method
   - Fixed date/time conversion issues

2. **Appointment Model**
   - Implemented `professional_available` validation
   - Implemented `student_age_appropriate` validation
   - Fixed professional lookup logic

3. **Serializers**
   - Fixed ActiveModelSerializers conditional attribute syntax
   - Changed `attributes :field, if: :method?` to `attribute :field, if: :method?`
   - Fixed method visibility issues (public vs private)

4. **Policy Scopes**
   - Fixed AppointmentPolicy::Scope to handle UserContext vs User
   - Added logic to extract actual user from UserContext wrapper

5. **Appointments Controller**
   - Fixed index action by adding `scope: current_user` to serializer
   - Only 1 out of 27 appointment tests now passing

## Major Issues Remaining

### 1. Serialization Context
All appointment actions except index are missing the scope context, causing:
- `undefined local variable or method 'current_user'` errors
- 500 errors on show, create, update, destroy actions

### 2. Organization Controller
- Returns 404 for authenticated requests
- Skip before_actions logic needs review
- Tenant resolution might be failing

### 3. Sidekiq Workers
- Using Symbol keys instead of String keys
- Example: `{ appointment_id: 123 }` should be `{ 'appointment_id' => 123 }`
- Causing job serialization errors

### 4. Authorization Issues
- State transition endpoints failing with 403 Forbidden
- Policy methods might not be properly checking permissions
- Pundit authorization not working as expected

### 5. Pending Examples
- 2 test files have pending examples without implementation
- Need to either implement or remove

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Serialization Context**: Add `scope: current_user` to all controller actions
2. **Fix Organization Controller**: Review authentication flow and tenant resolution
3. **Fix Worker Symbol Keys**: Update all worker calls to use String keys
4. **Fix Authorization**: Review and fix Pundit policies for state transitions
5. **Remove Pending Examples**: Clean up test suite

## Recommendation

The current approach of fixing issues one by one without running tests after each change has led to missing many problems. We need to:

1. Fix one issue at a time
2. Run the specific test immediately
3. Verify the fix works
4. Move to the next issue

This will prevent the cascade of failures we're currently seeing.
