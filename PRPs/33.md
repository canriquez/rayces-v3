# PRP-33: Complete Multi-Tenancy Implementation with acts_as_tenant

## Goal
Complete the multi-tenancy implementation for Rayces V3 by enabling full tenant isolation, implementing organization-scoped RBAC, and ensuring complete data segregation between organizations while maintaining backward compatibility with existing MyHub features.

## Why
- **Business Value**: Enable the platform to serve multiple educational/therapeutic institutions with complete data isolation
- **MVP Blocker**: This is critical for Sprint 1 completion and blocks most Sprint 2 & 3 stories
- **Security**: Prevent cross-tenant data access and ensure GDPR/HIPAA compliance for sensitive student/patient data
- **Scalability**: Foundation for multi-tenant SaaS architecture supporting unlimited organizations

## What
Transform the existing MyHub foundation into a fully operational multi-tenant platform where:
- Each organization has complete data isolation via subdomain-based routing
- Role-based access control is scoped to organizations
- API endpoints enforce tenant context and prevent cross-tenant access
- Comprehensive testing ensures tenant isolation and security

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Tenant Isolation**: Organizations cannot access each other's data under any circumstances
- [ ] **Subdomain Routing**: `org1.example.com` automatically sets tenant context to Organization(subdomain: 'org1')
- [ ] **RBAC Integration**: Roles (admin, professional, secretary, client) are organization-scoped
- [ ] **API Security**: All /api/v1/* endpoints enforce tenant context with JWT validation
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: 100% passing tests including new tenant isolation specs
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing MyHub social features continue working within tenant context

## All Needed Context

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
```ruby
# CRITICAL: acts_as_tenant 0.6 specifics
# - Must call ActsAsTenant.current_tenant= before any model queries
# - Test environment needs special handling to avoid require_tenant errors
# - Sidekiq jobs need manual tenant context preservation
# - JWT payloads must include organization_id for cross-validation

# GOTCHA: Current codebase patterns
# - ApplicationController has skip_tenant_in_tests? method
# - JWT authentication expects organization_id in token payload
# - Google OAuth flow requires organization context for user creation
# - Existing User model uses enum for roles, need to migrate to Role model

# CRITICAL: Database considerations  
# - All queries must include organization_id for performance
# - Composite indexes required: [:organization_id, :other_columns]
# - Unique constraints must be scoped to organization_id
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Core Models Enhancement
```ruby
# Complete the multi-tenant model hierarchy
class Role < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_tenant :organization
  # Organization-scoped roles: admin, professional, secretary, client
end

class UserRole < ApplicationRecord  
  acts_as_tenant :organization
  # Join table with validation for same-organization constraint
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_tenant :organization  # Enable in all environments
  # Add role management methods, maintain enum for backward compatibility
end
```

```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style  
```bash
# Run these FIRST - fix any errors before proceeding
cd rails-api
bundle exec rubocop --fix-layout --format=simple
bundle exec rails zeitwerk:check

# Expected: No errors. Critical for Rails autoloading.
```

### Level 2: Model and Unit Tests
```bash
# Test tenant-scoped models first
bundle exec rspec spec/models/organization_spec.rb spec/models/user_spec.rb -v
bundle exec rspec spec/models/role_spec.rb spec/models/user_role_spec.rb -v

# Test all model specs (should be 100% passing)
bundle exec rspec spec/models/ -v

# Expected: All tests pass. If failing, fix acts_as_tenant scoping issues.
```

### Level 3: Integration and Request Tests
```bash
# Test API endpoints with tenant context
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v1/ -v

# Test cross-tenant access prevention
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/authentication_spec.rb -v

# Expected: All 67 previously pending tests now pass with tenant isolation.
```

### Level 4: End-to-End Tenant Validation
```bash
# Start Rails server in development
bundle exec rails server -e development

# Test subdomain tenant resolution (requires lvh.me setup)
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://org1.lvh.me:3000/api/v1/users

# Expected: Returns users only from org1, validates JWT organization match.

# Test cross-tenant prevention
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ORG1_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "X-Organization-Subdomain: org2" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users

# Expected: 403 Forbidden - Invalid organization access.
```

## Final Validation Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass: `bundle exec rspec` (289 examples, 0 failures, 0 pending)
- [ ] No syntax errors: `bundle exec rails zeitwerk:check`
- [ ] No style violations: `bundle exec rubocop`
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified: Cross-org data access impossible
- [ ] Subdomain routing works: `org1.lvh.me:3000` sets correct tenant
- [ ] Header routing works: `X-Organization-Subdomain` header respected
- [ ] JWT validation enhanced: Organization mismatch returns 403
- [ ] Role assignment working: Organization-scoped RBAC functional
- [ ] Database performance: All queries include organization_id
- [ ] Background jobs: Tenant context preserved in Sidekiq

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't bypass tenant scoping - always use ActsAsTenant.current_tenant
- ❌ Don't hardcode organization_id - use current tenant context
- ❌ Don't skip tenant validation in controllers - security critical
- ❌ Don't break existing MyHub functionality - maintain compatibility  
- ❌ Don't ignore failing tests - tenant isolation must be bulletproof
- ❌ Don't use User.where directly - use policy scoping instead
- ❌ Don't forget composite indexes - performance will degrade
- ❌ Don't disable acts_as_tenant in production - data leakage risk

## Success Confidence Score: 9/10

**High confidence due to:**
- Complete foundation from SCRUM-32 (153/153 core tests passing)
- Comprehensive example files with proven patterns
- Clear task breakdown with existing code references
- Robust validation gates at each level
- Strong test coverage requirements (289 total examples expected)

**1 point deducted for:** Complex tenant resolution edge cases and potential Sidekiq integration challenges that may require iteration.
