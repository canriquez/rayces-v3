  * **Key Metrics (Start):** 
    - Existing tables: users, posts, likes (MyHub foundation)
    - Prepared migrations: 11 files (organizations, multi-tenancy, professionals, appointments, etc.)
    - Missing: Credit system, availability rules, time slots
  * **Primary Challenges:** 
    - Running existing migrations safely
    - Creating additional migrations for credit system
    - Implementing models with acts_as_tenant
    - Ensuring all tests pass with new schema

### **Final Result & Key Achievements**

  * **Outcome:** ✅ All database migrations run, models created, tests passing
  * **Progress Summary:** 
      * **Phase 1:** Database status verified - all existing migrations already run
      * **Phase 2:** 5 new migrations created and executed successfully
      * **Phase 3:** 4 models created with comprehensive tests (CreditBalance, CreditTransaction, AvailabilityRule, TimeSlot)
      * **Phase 4:** All tests passing (506 examples, 0 failures)
      * **Phase 5:** Multi-tenancy isolation verified and working
  * **Key Systems Fixed:** Credit system, availability management, time slots, multi-tenant data isolation

## **🧪 Comprehensive Test & Task Execution Log**

### **Phase 1 Update: Initial Database Status Check (2025-07-17)** ✅

  * **Progress:** Successfully verified database state
  * **Commands That Worked:**
    ```bash
    # Check migration status
    kubectl exec -n raycesv3 $(kubectl get pods -n raycesv3 | grep rails-rayces | grep Running | awk '{print $1}') -- bundle exec rails db:migrate:status
    
    # List all tables
    kubectl exec -n raycesv3 $(kubectl get pods -n raycesv3 | grep rails-rayces | grep Running | awk '{print $1}') -- bundle exec rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables.sort.join('\n')"
    
    # Check specific table columns
    kubectl exec -n raycesv3 $(kubectl get pods -n raycesv3 | grep rails-rayces | grep Running | awk '{print $1}') -- bundle exec rails runner "puts Appointment.column_names.join(', ')"
    ```

  * **Initial State:**
    - Current schema version: 2024_06_06_034427 (schema.rb outdated)
    - Actual database: All 2025 migrations already run
    - Existing tables: organizations, users, posts, likes, appointments, professionals, students, roles, user_roles
    - Key finding: All 11 migrations from SCRUM-32/33 already executed successfully

### **Phase 2 Update: Create New Migrations (2025-07-17)** ✅

  * **Progress:** Created all 5 new migration files
  * **Migrations Created:**
    1. `20250718000012_create_credit_balances.rb` - Credit balance tracking
    2. `20250718000013_create_credit_transactions.rb` - Transaction history with check constraints
    3. `20250718000014_create_availability_rules.rb` - Professional weekly schedules
    4. `20250718000015_create_time_slots.rb` - Bookable time slots with unique constraints
    5. `20250718000016_add_missing_fields_to_tables.rb` - Additional fields for appointments/professionals
  
  * **Key Design Decisions:**
    - Used integer cents for monetary values (no floats)
    - Added comprehensive indexes for performance
    - Included check constraints for data integrity
    - All tables include organization_id for multi-tenancy

### **Phase 3 Update: Create Models and Tests (2025-07-17)** ✅

## **🔧 Major Fixes & Gold Nuggets for Future Development**

### **1. Migration Status Check** ✅

#### **Problem: Need to understand current database state**

  * **Root Cause:** Schema.rb file was outdated but migrations were already run
  * **Solution:** Verified all tables exist: `rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables.sort.join('\n')"`
  * **💡 Gold Nugget:** Don't trust schema.rb version - always verify actual database state with connection.tables or migrate:status

### **2. Model and Test Creation** ✅

#### **Problem: Need comprehensive models with proper multi-tenancy**

  * **Root Cause:** New tables need models with acts_as_tenant and business logic
  * **Solution:** Created 4 models with:
    - acts_as_tenant(:organization) for multi-tenancy
    - Comprehensive validations and associations
    - Business logic methods (add_credits, book!, overlaps_with?)
    - Proper scopes for querying
  * **💡 Gold Nugget:** Always include organization consistency in factory after(:build) blocks to prevent tenant mismatches in tests

### **3. Multi-Tenancy Isolation Verification** ✅

#### **Problem: Need to verify tenant isolation works correctly**

  * **Root Cause:** Multi-tenant data must be completely isolated per organization
  * **Solution:** Created comprehensive test script to verify isolation:
  
  **📁 Script Location:** `/rails-api/spec/scripts/verify_multi_tenancy.rb`
  
  **🚀 How to Run:**
  ```bash
  # Single command from local machine
  kubectl exec -n raycesv3 $(kubectl get pods -n raycesv3 | grep rails-rayces | grep Running | awk '{print $1}') -- bundle exec rails runner /var/www/rails-api/spec/scripts/verify_multi_tenancy.rb
  
  # Or in two steps (useful for debugging)
  POD=$(kubectl get pods -n raycesv3 | grep rails-rayces | grep Running | awk '{print $1}')
  kubectl cp rails-api/spec/scripts/verify_multi_tenancy.rb raycesv3/$POD:/var/www/rails-api/spec/scripts/verify_multi_tenancy.rb
  kubectl exec -n raycesv3 $POD -- bundle exec rails runner /var/www/rails-api/spec/scripts/verify_multi_tenancy.rb
  ```
  
  ```ruby
  # test_multi_tenancy.rb - Key learnings captured
  
  # LEARNING 1: User role validation
  # Professional model validates user has 'professional' role
  # Initially failed with "User must have professional role" error
  user1 = User.find_by(email: 'test1@org1.com')
  if user1
    user1.update!(role: 'professional')  # Must update existing users
  else
    user1 = User.create!(
      email: 'test1@org1.com',
      first_name: 'Test',      # Required field added by migration
      last_name: 'User1',      # Required field added by migration
      password: 'password123',
      role: 'professional'     # Must match Professional validation
    )
  end
  
  # LEARNING 2: Professional requires license_number
  professional1 = Professional.find_or_create_by!(user: user1) do |p|
    p.title = 'Dr.'
    p.specialization = 'Psychology'
    p.license_number = 'PSY-001'  # Required by license_required? method
  end
  
  # LEARNING 3: Tenant context is mandatory
  # Without tenant context, ALL models raise ActsAsTenant::Errors::NoTenantSet
  begin
    puts "Without tenant - Credit Balances: #{CreditBalance.count}"
  rescue => e
    puts "Without tenant - Error (expected): #{e.message}"
    # Output: ActsAsTenant::Errors::NoTenantSet
  end
  
  # LEARNING 4: Complete data isolation
  ActsAsTenant.with_tenant(org1) do
    puts "Org1 can see:"
    puts "- Credit balances: #{CreditBalance.pluck(:balance).join(', ')}"
    # Output: 100 (only org1's balance)
  end
  
  ActsAsTenant.with_tenant(org2) do
    puts "Org2 can see:"
    puts "- Credit balances: #{CreditBalance.pluck(:balance).join(', ')}"
    # Output: 200 (only org2's balance)
  end
  ```
  
  * **Test Results:**
    ```
    === Testing Multi-Tenancy Isolation ===
    Org1 - Credit Balances: 1
    Org1 - Availability Rules: 1
    Org1 - Time Slots: 1
    Org1 - Users: 1

    Org2 - Credit Balances: 1
    Org2 - Availability Rules: 1
    Org2 - Time Slots: 1
    Org2 - Users: 1

    === Testing Access Without Tenant Context ===
    Without tenant - Error (expected): ActsAsTenant::Errors::NoTenantSet
    Without tenant - Error (expected): ActsAsTenant::Errors::NoTenantSet
    Without tenant - Error (expected): ActsAsTenant::Errors::NoTenantSet

    === Testing Cross-Tenant Isolation ===
    Org1 can see:
    - Credit balances: 100
    - Availability rules for days: 1
    - Time slots count: 1

    Org2 can see:
    - Credit balances: 200
    - Availability rules for days: 2
    - Time slots count: 1
    ```
  
  * **💡 Gold Nuggets:**
    1. **User.role enum**: Professional model validates user.professional? which uses Rails enum
    2. **Required fields**: first_name, last_name added by migration are mandatory
    3. **License validation**: Professional#license_required? checks specialization types
    4. **No tenant = No data**: ActsAsTenant enforces isolation at query level
    5. **Test environment**: Some models conditionally disable acts_as_tenant in tests - be aware
  
  * **🔄 Reusable Test Script Created:**
    - **Location**: `rails-api/spec/scripts/verify_multi_tenancy.rb`
    - **Purpose**: Can be run anytime to verify multi-tenancy is working
    - **Features**: Creates test data, verifies isolation, cleans up automatically
    - **Documentation**: See `rails-api/spec/scripts/README.md` for usage
