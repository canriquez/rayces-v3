- ‚úÖ Milestone countdown timers are accurate  
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking is updated with latest completions
- ‚úÖ Risk assessments reflect current project state
- ‚úÖ Assignee information is synchronized
- ‚úÖ Sprint status and commitments are current
- ‚úÖ All dates and timestamps are updated

---

## Daily Update Process

### STEP 1: Gather Current Project Status
Please execute the following analysis:

1. **Check Current Jira Project Status**
   - Search for all issues in SCRUM project with current status
   - Identify any status changes since last update
   - Check for new stories, epics, or changes in assignees
   - Verify current sprint status and active sprints
   - Calculate current milestone countdown (July 18, 2025 and August 31, 2025)

2. **Analyze Progress Changes**
   - Compare current status with previous documentation
   - Identify completed stories, status transitions, and blockers
   - Calculate updated progress percentages for each epic
   - Assess velocity and sprint commitments

3. **Update Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate current risks based on timeline and progress
   - Update probability and impact assessments
   - Identify new risks or resolved issues

### STEP 2: Update All Confluence Documentation

Based on the current status analysis, update these Confluence pages in order:

#### A. Homepage (Page ID: 65964)
**Updates Required:**
- Milestone countdown timers (calculate days remaining)
- Current status percentages and sprint information
- Risk dashboard with current high-priority risks
- Team assignments and workload distribution
- Recent updates section with today's date
- Quick actions with any urgent items

#### B. Epic & Story Tracking (Page ID: 66001)
**Updates Required:**
- All story statuses and assignee information
- Progress percentages for each epic
- Sprint assignments and commitments
- Milestone tracking checkboxes
- Burndown and velocity data
- Definition of Done status
- Last updated timestamp

#### C. Milestone Timeline & Critical Dates (Page ID: 66119)
**Updates Required:**
- Real-time countdown timers
- Sprint-by-sprint progress status
- Risk assessment matrix with current probabilities
- Success criteria completion status
- Contingency plan activation if needed

#### D. Project Plan (Page ID: 262145)
**Updates Required:**
- Timeline adjustments based on current progress
- Success criteria tracking updates
- Risk mitigation status updates
- Reference material updates

### STEP 3: Create Daily Status Summary

Generate a brief daily status summary including:
- **Progress Since Yesterday**: New completions, status changes
- **Today's Priorities**: Most critical tasks and blockers
- **Milestone Status**: Days remaining and trajectory
- **Risk Updates**: New risks or mitigations
- **Action Items**: Required decisions or escalations

## Automation Instructions

### Data Collection Commands
Execute these searches to gather current status:

```
1. Get all current issues and status:
   - Search: "project = SCRUM ORDER BY updated DESC"
   - Fields: summary, status, assignee, priority, issuetype, updated, progress

2. Get epic progress:
   - Search: "project = SCRUM AND issuetype = Epic ORDER BY updated DESC"
   - Fields: summary, status, description, updated

3. Check active sprints:
   - Search: "project = SCRUM AND sprint in openSprints()"
   - Identify any missing sprint structure

4. Find recent changes:
   - Search: "project = SCRUM AND updated >= -1d"
   - Track daily progress
```

### Milestone Calculations
```
Calculate days remaining:
- July 18, 2025 MVP Demo: Current date to July 18
- August 31, 2025 Full Implementation: Current date to August 31

Progress formulas:
- Epic Progress = (Completed Stories / Total Stories) * 100
- Overall Progress = Weighted average of critical epics
- Velocity = Story points completed / Sprint time
```

### Risk Assessment Matrix
```
Evaluate each risk:
- Timeline Risk = (Days Remaining / Planned Days) < 0.8 ? HIGH : MEDIUM
- Resource Risk = Single assignee for > 5 critical stories ? HIGH : MEDIUM  
- Technical Risk = Complex stories without clear definition ? MEDIUM : LOW
- Integration Risk = Dependencies between unfinished components ? HIGH : MEDIUM
```

## Confluence Update Templates

### Homepage Status Section Template
```markdown
### **Current Status** üü°

* **Phase**: [Current Phase] ([Status])
* **Progress**: [X]% Complete
* **Active Sprint**: [Sprint Name] OR **No Active Sprint** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Sprint creation required)
* **Next Milestone**: [Milestone] ([Date])
* **Primary Developer**: [Assignee] ([X] critical stories assigned)
```

### Risk Dashboard Template
```markdown
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Risk Name]** | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | üî¥/üü°/üü¢ [Status] |
```

### Epic Progress Template
```markdown
| Epic | Target Date | Progress | Critical Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Epic Name]** ([JIRA-KEY]) | [Date] | üü´ [X]% | üî•/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚è≥ [Level] |
```

## Quality Checks

### Before Publishing Updates
Verify these items:

- [ ] **Date Accuracy**: All dates reflect current day (July X, 2025)
- [ ] **Countdown Accuracy**: Milestone days remaining are mathematically correct
- [ ] **Status Sync**: Jira status matches Confluence documentation
- [ ] **Assignee Sync**: All assignee information is current
- [ ] **Progress Logic**: Progress percentages make sense vs. completed work
- [ ] **Risk Relevance**: Risk assessments reflect current project state
- [ ] **Link Validity**: All Jira links and internal links are functional
- [ ] **Formatting**: Tables, lists, and markdown render correctly

### Escalation Triggers
Immediately flag these situations:

- üö® **Critical**: Milestone risk > 80% (less than 3 days buffer)
- üö® **Critical**: No progress on critical path items for 48+ hours  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High**: Single developer assigned to > 70% of critical work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High**: No active sprints within 48 hours of sprint dates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium**: Risk probability increased for existing high-impact risks
